R package for the analysis of post-translational modifications, with particular emphasis on the sulfoxidation (oxidation) of methionine residues.

Extensive and detailed documentation related to this package can be found at https://metositeptm.com.

Nevertheless, if you want to use them, still you can just downloading and installing previous verisons of ptm. For instance:

`devtools::install_github(repo = "jcaledo/renzGH", subdir = "Versions/renz_v0.1.1")`
